The safe version (by safe I mean the one before regular deadline) is here \<a href="https://evanyangab.github.io/final_project.html">Final project - Alaska</a>

The better version (which is not only using the data from alaska, but from the whole america population) is still running

The interactive version, after I figure out how to setup a shiny server, will be linked here also. It can be used to generate predicted income by user input.
